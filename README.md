# gdbfile-64: Emulated N64 file system access via GDB

*Allows an N64 ROM running in the [**ares** emulator](https://ares-emu.net/) to detect changes and pull updated files from the host.**

Homebrew ROMs made with the [**libdragon** SDK](https://libdragon.dev/) can already use a simulated DragonFS (DFS) filesystem.
Files are bundled in the ROM on build time and can be read via `fopen` and other common C standard library functions.
But what if you'd like to reload or write a file when the program is running?

This library, **gdbfile-64**, allows an N64 ROM running in the **ares** emulator to read and write files at runtime.
It's based on breakpoints set on specific hooked functions, calls to which are intercepted and handled by a separate GDB Python script.
Only files in a specific directory are accessible.

So far this is **Linux-only**. Windows support may be possible.

## Building and running

You need to set the `N64_INST` environment variable before building.
Then build `example.n64`:

```
make
```

To test that everything works, first start the file hook.
As arguments you give

- the directory to let the ROM access, and
- the ELF file for symbols of the running ROM.

```
./run_file_hook.sh testfiles build/example.elf
```

Then launch **ares** with [the GDB support and homebrew mode turned on](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/wiki/Debugging-via-gdb):

```
ares example.n64
```

Now when you edit `testfiles/hello.txt` you should see it updated in **ares**.
Also a `testfiles/output.txt` file should've appeared:

```
$ cat testfiles/output.txt 
It works!‚èé                                      
```
